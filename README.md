Rossmann stores sales analysis in Alemania using SQL and Power BI

##  Rossmann Sales Analysis

This project aims to analyze the sales performance of Rossmann drugstores across Germany using **SQL** for data exploration and **Power BI** for visualization. It also includes **diagnostic and potentially predictive analysis** to better understand the drivers behind sales patterns and identify actionable strategies.

---

## Project Objective

Conduct exploratory and diagnostic data analysis to understand how sales vary across store types, German states, calendar factors (day of week, holidays), and customer behavior. The project also explores the feasibility of a simple predictive model to forecast future sales trends.

---

## Tools & Technologies

- **SQL** – Data cleaning and analysis  
- **Power BI** – Interactive dashboards and visual storytelling  
- **GitHub** – Project documentation and version control  
- (Optionally: Excel or Python for diagnostics/predictions)

---

## Phase 1: Data Cleaning

- Verified and corrected:
  - Data types
  - Missing values
  - Duplicate records
  - Outliers and inconsistent entries
  - Date formatting
  - Category consistency (`StoreType`, `StateHoliday`, etc.)

---

## Phase 2: Exploratory Analysis

- Sales and customer distribution
- Regional performance (by state)
- Temporal patterns (month, weekday, holidays)
- Comparison by store type and assortment level

---

## Phase 3: Diagnostic Analysis

- Investigating relationships between:
  - Number of customers and total sales
  - Store characteristics and performance
  - Holiday or seasonal impact on sales
- Correlation matrix to identify influencing factors

---

## Phase 4: Predictive Analysis

- Exploratory forecasting using historical data
- Assessing the suitability of linear regression or time series models (e.g., moving average)
- Objective: estimate future sales trends or identify stores at risk of underperformance

---

## Phase 5: Visualization

- Power BI dashboard with interactive charts
- KPIs by region, time, and store type
- Map visualizations for geographic insights
