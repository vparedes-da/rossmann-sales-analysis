# Rossmann Sales Analysis Project
Student: Valentina Paredes
Presented to: Unicorn Academy

## Project Overview

This project analyzes historical sales data from Rossmann stores across different German states (public data base in kaggle). The goal is to identify key factors that influence sales performance and to develop actionable strategies to improve business outcomes through data analytics.

The analysis is conducted using SQL for data handling and Power BI for visualizations. All findings and visual products are shared with the intention of building a professional data portfolio and fostering discussion on LinkedIn.

## Project Objective

The primary goal of this project is to understand the key factors that drive sales in Rossmann stores and provide actionable insights to enhance sales performance.

**Business Question**  
_What factors drive sales in Rossmann stores, and how can we use them to optimize commercial performance at the regional and temporal level?_

To answer this, we aim to:

- Perform **descriptive analysis** to explore patterns by time, store type, and location.
- Use **diagnostic analysis** to identify the factors that contribute to underperforming or outperforming stores.
- A predictive modeling phase (e.g., sales forecasting) is planned as future work and may be developed in a subsequent iteration of the project.

This project supports data-driven decision-making and aims to uncover strategies that could potentially increase sales by at least 5% compared to the previous year.
